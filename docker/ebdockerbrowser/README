This is a two window tmux session set to use the screen default escape sequence of Ctrl-a
[0m
So to move between the two windows you need to type the escape sequence, release, then the command
ex: [0;33mCtrl-a, p[0m and [0;33m Ctrl-a, n [0m

The RootWindow is provided as a convenience to run yum commands and install
prebuilt EasyBuild toolchains

You might try: [0;33myum install foss-2015b[0m to install a GCC toolchain with openmpi
